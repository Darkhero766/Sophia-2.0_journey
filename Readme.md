## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Sophia v2 up and running on your system, especially if you're using Replit.

### Prerequisites

* **Python 3.x**
* **Java Development Kit (JDK):** `language-tool-python` relies on Java. Most Replit environments come with Java pre-installed.

### Installation

1.  **Clone or Download the Project:**
    If you're using Replit, simply open your project. If you're setting this up locally, download the code files to your computer.

2.  **Create `requirements.txt`:**
    In the root directory of your project, create a file named `requirements.txt` (if it doesn't already exist). Add the following lines to it:
    ```
    nltk
    language-tool-python
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Replit usually installs packages automatically from `requirements.txt`. If not, or if you're running locally, open your terminal/shell and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Chatbot

1.  **Execute the Main Script:**
    Open your terminal or Replit's shell and run the main Python file:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    (Replace `main.py` with the actual name of your Python file if it's different.)

2.  **First Run (Important!):**
    The very first time you run Sophia v2, the `language-tool-python` library will download necessary language models. This can take anywhere from **30 seconds to a few minutes** depending on your internet connection and system performance. Please be patient during this initial setup.
